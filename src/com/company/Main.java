 Create a calculator with the following methods:
-   add: takes two double parameters, and returns a double of them added together
-   subtract: takes two double parameters, and returns a double of the first minus the second
-   multiply: takes two double parameters, and return a double of them multiplied together
-   divide: takes two double parameters, and returns the first divided by the second

-   takes in two numbers and an operator
-   depending on the operator, runs one of the other methods and returns the result
